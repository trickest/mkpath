<h3 align="center">Make URL path combinations using a wordlist</h3>

![mkpath](mkpath.png "mkpath")

Read a wordlist file and generate path combinations for given domain or list of domains. Input from wordlist file is lowercased and unique words are processed. Additionally, wordlist can be filtered using regex. 

When you use mkpath's `-l` parameter, it will generate all path combinations up to the specified level, including all lower levels, using words from the wordlist. For instance, with `-l 2`, it will generate `len(permutation_list)^2 + len(permutation_list)` results, which is:
- 30 combinations for a 5-word wordlist.
- 10100 combinations for a 100-word wordlist. 
- 250500 combinations for a 500-word wordlist.
